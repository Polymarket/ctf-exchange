## Background

The Polymarket CTF Exchange is an exchange protocol that facilitates atomic swaps between [Conditional Tokens Framework(CTF)](https://docs.gnosis.io/conditionaltokens/) ERC1155 assets and an ERC20 collateral asset.

It is intended to be used in a hybrid-decentralized exchange model wherein there is an operator that provides offchain matching services while settlement happens on-chain, non-custodial.


## Documentation

Docs for the CTF Exchange are available in this repo [here](./docs/Overview.md).

## Audit

These contracts have been audited by Chainsecurity and the report is available [here](./audit/ChainSecurity_Polymarket_Exchange_audit.pdf).
